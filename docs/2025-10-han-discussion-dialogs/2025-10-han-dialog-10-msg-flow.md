>Okay can you illustrate to me how those messages flow in a deeper hierarchical network? No details - just what messages to whom and what next!

Perfect — let’s keep it **super high-level** and just show the *flow of messages across layers* without diving into guts. Think of it like a relay of signals up and down a hierarchy:

---

# Message Flow in a Deep HAN

**Layer 0 — Atoms (cells)**

* *Message:* “Here’s my local draft / observation.”
* *To:* Neighbor atoms inside a motif.
* *Next:* Atoms combine → form a small **motif output**.

---

**Layer 1 — Motifs (organs)**

* *Message:* “This block/module is now consistent.”
* *To:* Other motifs inside the same tissue.
* *Next:* Motifs coordinate → propose an **integrated block**.

---

**Layer 2 — Tissues (subsystems)**

* *Message:* “Here’s a working subsystem plan/output.”
* *To:* Other tissues in the organism.
* *Next:* Subsystems synchronize → yield a **whole solution candidate**.

---

**Layer 3 — Organism (individual agent)**

* *Message:* “This is my full solution + confidence + cost.”
* *To:* Peer organisms (if in a group) or to environment.
* *Next:* Organisms share → converge to a **group decision**.

---

**Layer 4 — Group / Society**

* *Message:* “Consensus proposal / vote / critique.”
* *To:* Other groups or meta-coordinator.
* *Next:* Groups merge perspectives → form a **collective answer**.

---

# The pattern

At each layer:

1. **Nodes send summaries upward** (“I’m stable now”).
2. **Peers exchange laterally** (“Here’s my part, check consistency”).
3. **Coordinator routes feedback downward** (“Adjust your part”).
4. Process repeats until convergence, then passes results upward.

---

So it’s always:
**local draft → local convergence → upward summary → lateral coordination → downward adjustment → repeat.**

---

Would you like me to sketch this as a **single layered diagram** (like a pyramid with arrows going up, sideways, and back down) so the recursive structure is crystal clear?
